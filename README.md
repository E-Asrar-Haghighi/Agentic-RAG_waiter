# Agentic RAG Waiter  

## Overview  
This project implements an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for a waiter assistant. The AI agent is designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information and assist in various tasks such as handling customer inquiries, menu recommendations, and order management.  

## Features  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances response accuracy by combining retrieval-based knowledge with generative AI.  
- **Agentic Behavior:** The system autonomously processes user queries and makes intelligent decisions.  
- **Multi-modal Support:** Handles text-based inputs and can be extended for voice-based interactions.  
- **Integration with External APIs:** Connects with databases or knowledge sources for dynamic updates.  

## Technologies Used  
- **LangChain** for agentic workflows  
- **FAISS** for efficient similarity search  
- **LLMs (GPT-based models)** for response generation  
- **Python** for implementation and experimentation  

## Usage  
- Load the model and knowledge base.  
- Input customer queries to generate intelligent responses.  
- Customize the system to handle restaurant-specific data.  

## Future Improvements  
- Integrating real-time order processing  
- Enhancing multi-modal capabilities  
- Deploying as a web-based chatbot or voice assistant
